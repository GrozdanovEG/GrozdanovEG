### Emil Grozdanov - PHP Developer graduate 

 Initially a tech enthusiast, during the recent 6+ months moving towards becoming an IT professional, mostly focused on (backend) web development (with PHP for now).  

 Between Sept 2022 and March 2022 I had been studying at [Jagaad Academy](https://academy.jagaad.com/) and had been focused on Backend development with *PHP*, *Symfony*, *MySQL*,  *Object-Oriented Programming* and other important concepts. Check out some of my projects here on GitHub; they cover different topics I'm studying.

**Currently, I'm looking for opportunities to practice the topics I had been studying by  working as a junior or intern developer**. 
*Other roles /positions are also considered as acceptable option.*

Learning more about code and contributing to great solutions is something I enjoy and want to work with
