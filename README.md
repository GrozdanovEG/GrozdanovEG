### Emil Grozdanov - PHP Developer Student 

 I'm studying at [Jagaad Academy](https://academy.jagaad.com/) and have been focusing on Backend development with *PHP*, *Symfony*, *MySQL*, and *Object-Oriented Programming*. Check out some of my projects here on GitHub; they cover different topics I'm studying.

**Currently, I'm looking for an opportunity to work as a junior or intern developer**.  
*Other roles /positions are also considered as acceptable option.*

Learning more about code and contributing to great solutions is something I enjoy and want to work with.
