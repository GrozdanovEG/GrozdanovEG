### Emil Grozdanov - PHP Developer graduate 

 Initially a tech enthusiast, during the recent 6+ months moving towards becoming an IT professional, mostly focused on (backend) web development (with PHP for now).  

 Between Sept 2022 and March 2023 I had been studying at [Jagaad Academy](https://academy.jagaad.com/) and had been focused on Backend development with *PHP*, *Symfony*, *MySQL*,  *Object-Oriented Programming* and other important concepts. Check out some of my projects here on GitHub /[Web Shopping Application](https://github.com/GrozdanovEG/web-shopping), [Blog Posts Handling API](https://github.com/GrozdanovEG/api-blog-posts)/; they cover different topics I was studying.  
  I also have significant backgroung with the UNIX platform in general, and especally with several Linux distributions (Slackware, Fedora, Debian, EuroLinux) as a desktop and server platform.

**Currently, I'm looking for opportunities to practice the topics I had been studying by working as a junior or intern developer** but *other roles /positions are also considered as acceptable option.* 

*I am also interested to be involved in open source projects, to practice my skills and teamwork*.
